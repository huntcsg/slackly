    Navigating through collections of messages
    The messages array contains up to 100 messages between latest and oldest. If
    there were more than 100 messages between those two points, then has_more
    will be true.
    If a message has the same timestamp as latest or oldest it will not be
    included in the list, unless inclusive is true. This allows a client to
    fetch all messages in a hole in channel history, by calling channels.history
    with latest set to the oldest message they have after the hole, and oldest
    to the latest message they have before the hole. If the response includes
    has_more then the client can make another call, using the ts value of the
    final messages as the latest param to get the next page of messages.
    If there are more than 100 messages between the two timestamps then the
    messages returned are the ones closest to latest. In most cases an
    application will want the most recent messages and will page backward from
    there. If oldest is provided but not latest then the messages returned are
    those closest to oldest, allowing you to page forward through history if
    desired.
    
    Retrieving a single message
    channels.history can also be used to pluck a single message from the archive.
    You'll need a message's ts value, uniquely identifying it within a channel.  You'll also need that channel's ID.
    Provide another message's ts value as the latest parameter. Specify true for the inclusive parameter and set the count to 1. If it exists, you'll receive the queried message in return.
    GET /api/channels.history?token=TOKEN_WITH_CHANNELS_HISTORY_SCOPE&channel=C2EB2QT8A&latest=1476909142.000007&inclusive=true&count=1
    
    
    Message types
    Messages of type "message" are user-entered text messages sent to the channel, while other types are events that happened within the channel. All messages have both a type and a sortable ts, but the other fields depend on the type. For a list of all possible events, see the channel messages documentation.
    Messages that have been reacted to by team members will have a reactions array delightfully included.
    If a message has been starred by the calling user, the is_starred property will be present and true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.
    The is_limited boolean property is only included for free teams that have
    reached the free message limit. If true, there are messages before the current
    result set, but they are beyond the message limit.
