    will be true.
    If a message has the same timestamp as latest or oldest it will not be
    included in the list, unless inclusive is true. This allows a client to
    fetch all messages in a hole in channel history, by calling channels.history
    with latest set to the oldest message they have after the hole, and oldest
    to the latest message they have before the hole. If the response includes
    has_more then the client can make another call, using the ts value of the
    final messages as the latest param to get the next page of messages.
    If there are more than 100 messages between the two timestamps then the
    messages returned are the ones closest to latest. In most cases an
    application will want the most recent messages and will page backward from
    there. If oldest is provided but not latest then the messages returned are
    those closest to oldest, allowing you to page forward through history if
    desired.
    Messages of type "message" are user-entered text messages sent to the direct message channel, while other types
    are events that happened within the direct message channel. All messages have both a type and a sortable
    ts, but the other fields depend on the type. For a list of all possible events,
    see the channel messages documentation.
    If a message has been starred by the calling user, the is_starred property will be present and
    true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.
    The is_limited boolean property is only included for free teams that have
    reached the free message limit. If true, there are messages before the current
    result set, but they are beyond the message limit.
